# Menstrumate
Hosted on: https://menstrumate.onrender.com  (using render)
My first full stack web app made using flask
This website allows people to track their menstrual cycle. It calculates their expected ovulation, fertile period and next period.
I created this website using flask, html and css only keeping it simple and used sqlite3 for database management.
